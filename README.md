## Usage

Clone, and cd into the `cordevicljs` folder.

```
lein figwheel
```

Wait for figwheel to finish and notify browser of changed files!

Then in another terminal tab:

```
lein run
```

Then in a third tab:

```
cd resources
cordova platform add browser
cordova platform add ios|android
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-device
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.dialogs
cordova run browser
```

This should show a mobile flat UI native like interface with a slider menu and a JavaScript alert telling you that Native Device bridge is working.

Then to test in device emulator:

```
cordova run ios|android
```

Refer to XCode/Android SDK manuals if this won't work.

If it works you should see the same app as before, but this time with a real native dialog instead of a JavaScript alert.
